# Projects

| Project Link | Area | Project Description |  
|---|---|---|
|[Customer Segmentation of Online Retail Sales using RFM analysis](https://github.com/sekhrianchal6/Customer-Segmentation-of-Online-Retail-Sales-Data-using-RFM-ANALYSIS/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20of%20Online%20Retail%20Sales%20Data%20using%20RFM%20ANALYSIS.ipynb) | Data Analysis & Unsupervised Machine Learning | Cleaned and transformed Sales data, performed RFM analysis and segment customers based on RFM scores. Applied K-means Clustering Algorithm to the preprocessed RFM data. Assign meaningful labels to each cluster based on the RFM characteristics of the customers  | 
|[Air Quality Analysis-India](https://github.com/sekhrianchal6/Air-quality-analysis-India/blob/main/Air%20quality%20analysis-India%20(1).ipynb) | Data Wrangling & Machine Learning | Analyzed the data to understand trends and patterns between different pollutants and meteorological variables. Applied Regression models to the transformed data| 
|[Diet analysis to predict child malnutrition](https://github.com/sekhrianchal6/Using-diet-Analysis-to-predict-child-malnutrition/blob/main/hdsc_winter_23_seaborn_capstone_project_machine_learning_mode_1.ipynb)| EDA & Regression Algorithms| Collected data is processed, cleaned, and analyzed using statistical methods. 6 Machine learning regression algorithms and Deep learning algortithms are trained to analyze the dietary data and predict malnutrition risk. Predictive models developed are evaluated and validated using appropriate metrics.|
|[Maternal health risk prediction](https://github.com/sekhrianchal6/Maternal-health-risk-prediction/blob/main/Arima_Final%20-%20update.ipynb)| Data Analysis & Classification Algorithms|Transform and Analysed the data and Identified the relevant features that can help in prediction. Applied appropriate classification machine learning algorithms and trained models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score etc.|
